A collection of configs to be placed in the users home directory usually prefixed with a period, hence the name dotfiles.


- i3 - Pretty stock simple config bar is commented out.
  
- polybar - Multi head 2 bar setup for i3 or openbox.
  
- openbox - Fairly complete rc.xml, bit of a different menu structure. Excluding the themes, for my openbox themes collections please check my another repo.
  
- zsh - Modified powerlevel9k, decent zshrc.
  
- compton - Blur heavy glx or more basic xrender configs.

- conky - Just a single conkyrc, for my another conky collections please check my other repos.

- tint2 - Just a single tint2rc, for my another tint2 collections please check my another repo.


I don't remember one by one what packages need to be installed to make everything works. But I have generated my-package-list.txt file. Maybe it can help You to decide what packages need to be installed if You want to use these dotfiles.
