## Introduction
A collection of configs to be placed in the users home directory usually prefixed with a period, hence the name dotfiles.
This repo is actually intended for my personal backup, but everyone are welcome to use these resources.

## Containing

- **Openbox** <br /> Fairly complete ```rc.xml```, organized menu, and option to ```use menu.xml``` with icons (I'm using [Sardi Ghost Flexible](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sardi-icons) icons).
For my openbox themes collections please check my [Openbox-Theme-Collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/Openbox-Theme-Collections).

- **i3** <br /> i3 Pretty stock simple config. My default config is using i3blocks as statusbar. To replace it with Polybar simply edit the config, uncomment the Polybar execution and remove the i3bar.

- **i3blocks** A simple i3 block config for i3 bar.

## Package List
I don't remember one by one what packages need to be installed to make everything works.
But I have generated my-package-list.txt file. Maybe it can help You to decide what packages need to be installed if You want to use these dotfiles.

## Credits
These dotfiles are not my only work. I will update this part later. Promise!
